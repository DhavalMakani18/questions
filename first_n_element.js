/*
User Input :
You should have noted that prompt returns the user input as a string, but what if you want the user input to return a number instead of a string? You can convert the string to an integer using parseInt()â€¦or you could just use the CodeHS library! The CodeHS JavaScript library includes the following commands:

readLine(prompt): Reads a string value from a user
readInt(prompt): Reads an integer value from a user
readFloat(prompt): Reads a float value from a user
